# UI Libraries

## Overview

### What is a UI component library?

A UI component library is a (usually) set of ready-made UI components such as:

- buttons
- inputs
- dialogs
- and so on.

They serve as building blocks for layouts. Thanks to their modular nature, we can arrange components in many different ways to achieve unique effects. Each library has a distinctive look and feel, but most of them offer theming, and their components are customizable to a certain degree.

### Benefits of a UI component library

Libraries are made to make developers' lives easier, and UI component libraries are no different. Beyond that, there are many more benefits of using such libraries:

- Speed
- Ease of use
- Attractive look
- Compatibility
- Accessibility

### Using UI component libraries - potential challenges

Even if your use case fits perfectly, there are some things you better keep in mind:

- Generic look
- Change of design direction
- New team members
- Bundle size

### When to use a UI component library?

In general, UI component libraries are most useful for projects that focus more on functionality rather than the visual aspect of the app. Here are a few examples:

- Administration panels
- Proofs of concept
- Projects with no designer

### Is there an alternative to a UI component library?

If you decide that a component library isn't a good fit for your project, you're not left alone in the dark. You can take advantage of other options that provide a more lightweight or custom alternative.

Here are two types of solutions worth considering:

- **Lightweight CSS frameworks** such as Tailwind or Pure – they offer a minimal, less opinionated CSS foundation that will help you speed up development, at the same time allowing tremendous flexibility.
- **Custom component libraries** – if you're working on a large project that requires a high level of UI customization or you find yourself repeating the same UI patterns across projects, consider creating an internal UI component-sharing platform. Bit is a trending tool. You should definitely check it out.

### Let's wrap this up

#### Using Existing UI Component Library

**PROS**

- Improved functionality
- Easier to implement
- No need for a designer
- Cheaper
- Reduced code duplication
- More Consistent
- Improved speed and compatibility

**CONS**

- Most likely a more generic look
- Less flexibility
- Harder to change direction
- Larger bundle
- Potentially a decreased responsiveness

#### Creating Visual Identity From Scratch

**PROS**

- A more personalized look
- More flexible and easier to re-design
- More control over bundle size
- Most likely more responsive
- More control in general
- Once created, easily applicable to other projects

**CONS**

- More expensive
- Requires far more work
- Requires a skilled team of designers

### Overview MUI component library.

MUI is a collection of UI tools and component libraries that helps you bring great designs to life in no time. The most popular of these is MUI Core.

MUI Core contains 4 foundational libraries:

- **Material UI:** A library of React UI components that implements Google's Material Design. (Source: Material UI)
- **Joy UI:** A library of beautifully designed React UI components built to spark joy in the development process. (Source: Joy UI)
- **MUI Base:** A library of headless ("unstyled") React UI components and low-level hooks. (Source: MUI Base)
- **MUI System:** A collection of CSS utilities for rapidly laying out custom designs with MUI component libraries. (Source: MUI System)

The most popular library created by MUI and preferred by developers for designing components is Material UI. It's an open-source project that has amassed more than 96K stars on GitHub as of June 2025.

### Advantages of Material UI

- Ship faster
- Beautiful by default
- Customizability
- Cross-team collaboration
- Trusted by thousands of organizations

### Key parts of Material UI

- Components
- Component API
- Customization
- Guides for different cases (routing, TS, responsive, bundle size, etc)
- Migrations
