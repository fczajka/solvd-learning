# JS Basics part 2

### Objects

#### Creating empy Object

```
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax
let user = Object.create({});
```

#### Literals and properties

We can immediately put some properties into `{...}` as `"key: value"` pairs:

```
let user = {    // an object
  name: "John", // by key "name" store value "John"
  age: 30       // by key "age" store value 30
};
```

A property has a key (also known as "name" or "identifier") before the colon `":"` and a value to the right of it.

In the `user` object, there are two properties:

- The first property has the name `"name"` and the value `"John"`.
- The second one has the name `"age"` and the value `30`.

#### Remove a property

```
delete user.age;
// not recomended
```

#### Multiword property

We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:

```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true // multiword property name must be quoted
};
```

#### Square brackets

```
// this would give a syntax error
user.likes birds = true
```

```
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```

#### Computed properties

We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That's called computed properties.
For instance:

```
let fruit = prompt('Which fruit to buy?', 'apple');

let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
};

alert(bag.apple); // 5 if fruit = "apple"
```

#### Property value shorthand

We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:

```
let user = {
  name, // same as name: name
  age: 30
};
```

#### "in" operator

To check if a property with the given key exists

```
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

console.log("age" in user); // true, user.age exists
console.log("height" in user); // false, user.height doesn't exist
```

#### The "for...in" loop

To iterate over an object

```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};

for (let key in user) {
  // keys
  console.log(key); // name, age, isAdmin
  // values for the keys
  console.log(user[key]); // John, 30, true
}
```

#### Object references and copying

One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied "by reference", whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc. are always copied "as a whole value".
That's easy to understand if we look a bit under the hood of what happens when we copy a value.
Let's start with a primitive, such as a string.

Here we put a copy of `message` into `phrase`:

```
let message = "Hello!";
let phrase = message;
```

As a result we have two independent variables, each one storing the string "Hello!".

#### Object references and copying 2

A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its "address in memory" - in other words "a reference" to it.

When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.

For instance:

```
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = user; // copy the reference
```

Now we have two variables, each storing a reference to the same object.

#### Cloning and merging, Object.assign

It copies the properties of all source objects into the target `dest`, and then returns it as the result.

```
Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...])
```

- The first argument `dest` is a target object.
- Further arguments `src1`, `src2`, ..., `srcN` (can be as many as needed) are source objects.
- It copies the properties of all source objects `src1`, `src2`, ..., `srcN` into the target `dest`. In other words, properties of all arguments starting from the second are copied into the first object.
- The call returns `dest`.

#### Shallow clone vs Deep clone

- Shallow copy: means that only the first level of the object is copied. Deeper levels are referenced.
- Deep copy: means that all levels of the object are copied. This is a true copy of the object.

#### Shallow Clone vs Deep Clone

##### Shallow Clone

- Shallow copy is faster.
- It stores the references of an object to the original memory address.
- It reflects changes made in the copied object to the original object.
- Both copied and original object point to the same memory location.
- You can shallow copy using `const userCopy = { ...user }`, Object.assign()

##### Deep Clone

- Deep copy is slower as compared to shallow copy.
- It only stores the copy of the object's value.
- It does not reflect any change to the new object.
- Copied and original object do not point to the same memory location.
- You can deep copy using JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify(), structuredClone()

##### useEffect

- It make shallow checking for items in dependency array, it uses Object.is() which is shallow equality
- Passing objects in dependency array is not recomended

#### Object methods

A function that is a property of an object is called its **method**.

```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

user.sayHi = function() {
  alert("Hello!");
};

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

#### Method shorthand

```
// these objects do the same
let user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function() { ... }"
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

#### "this" in methods

To access the object, a method can use the `this` keyword.

```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  sayHi() {
    // "this" is the "current object"
    alert(this.name);
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // John
```

#### Object methods summary

- Functions that are stored in object properties are called "methods".
- Methods allow objects to "act" like `object.doSomething()`.
- Methods can reference the object as `this`.

The value of `this` is defined at run-time.

- When a function is declared, it may use `this`, but that `this` has no value until the function is called.
- A function can be copied between objects.
- When a function is called in the "method" syntax: `object.method()`, the value of `this` during the call is `object`.

#### Constructor function

Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:

- They are named with a capital letter first.
- They should be executed only with the `"new"` operator.
- We use constructor function when creating a lot of (the same) things

For instance:

```
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

console.log(user.name); // Jack
console.log(user.isAdmin); // false
```

#### Constructor function

When a function is executed with `new`, it does the following steps:

- A new empty object is created and assigned to `this`.
- The function body executes. Usually it modifies `this`, adds new properties to it.
- The value of `this` is returned.

In other words, `new User(...)` does something like:

```
function User(name) {
  // this = {};                  (implicitly)

  // add properties to this
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;

  // return this; (implicitly)
}
```

#### Optional chaining '?.'

The optional chaining `?.` syntax has three forms:

- `obj?.prop` returns `obj.prop` if `obj` exists, otherwise `undefined`.
- `obj?.[prop]` - returns `obj[prop]` if `obj` exists, otherwise `undefined`.
- `obj.method?.()` calls `obj.method()` if `obj.method` exists, otherwise returns `undefined`.

### Arrays

#### Create an array

- `[element0, element1, ..., elementN]`
- `new Array(element0, element1[, ...[, elementN]])`
- `new Array(arrayLength)`
- `Array.of(element0, element1, ..., elementN)`

#### pop

Extracts the last element of the array and returns it:

```
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];

console.log(fruits.pop()); // remove "Pear" and log it

console.log(fruits); // Apple, Orange
```

#### push

Append the element to the end of the array:

```
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange"];

fruits.push("Pear");

console.log(fruits); // Apple, Orange, Pear
```

#### shift

Extracts the first element of the array and returns it:

```
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Pear'];

console.log(fruits.shift()); // remove Apple and alert it

console.log(fruits); // Orange, Pear
```

#### unshift

Add the element to the beginning of the array:

```
let fruits = ["Orange", "Pear"];

fruits.unshift('Apple');

console.log(fruits); // Apple, Orange, Pear
```

#### Performance

Methods `push` / `pop` run fast, while `shift` / `unshift` are slow.

#### length

The `length` property automatically updates when we modify the array. To be precise, it is actually not the count of values in the array, but the greatest numeric index plus one.

For instance, a single element with a large index gives a big length:

```
let fruits = [];
fruits[123] = "Apple";

console.log(fruits.length); // 124
```

#### Loops

To loop over the elements of the array:

- `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)` - works fastest, old-browser-compatible.
- `for (let item of arr)` - the modern syntax for items only.
- `for (let i in arr)` - never use.

#### splice

```
arr.splice(start[, deleteCount, elem1, ..., elemN])
```

Modifies `arr` starting from the index `start`: removes `deleteCount` elements and then inserts `elem1`, ..., `elemN` at their place. Returns the array of removed elements.

This method is easy to grasp by examples.

Let's start with the deletion:

```
let arr = ["I", "study", "JavaScript"];

arr.splice(1, 1); // from index 1 remove 1 element

console.log(arr); // ["I", "JavaScript"]
```

#### slice

The method `arr.slice` is much simpler than similar-looking `arr.splice`.

The syntax is:

```
arr.slice([start], [end])
```

It returns a new array copying to it all items from index `start` to `end` (not including `end`). Both `start` and `end` can be negative, in that case, the position from the array end is assumed.

It's similar to a string method `str.slice`, but instead of substrings it makes subarrays.

For instance:

```
let arr = ["t", "e", "s", "t"];

console.log(arr.slice(1, 3)); // e, s (copy from 1 to 3)

console.log(arr.slice(-2)); // s, t (copy from -2 till the end)
```

We can also call it without arguments: `arr.slice()` creates a copy of `arr`. That's often used to obtain a copy for further transformations that should not affect the original array.

#### concat

The method `arr.concat` creates a new array that includes values from other arrays and additional items.

The syntax is:

```
arr.concat(arg1, arg2...)
```

It accepts any number of arguments - either arrays or values.

The result is a new array containing items from `arr`, then `arg1`, `arg2`, etc.

If an argument `argN` is an array, then all its elements are copied. Otherwise, the argument itself is copied.

For instance:

```
let arr = [1, 2];

// create an array from: arr and [3, 4]
alert(arr.concat([3, 4])); // 1,2,3,4

// create an array from: arr and [3, 4] and [5, 6]
alert(arr.concat([3, 4], [5, 6])); // 1,2,3,4,5,6

// create an array from: arr and [3, 4], then add values 5 and 6
console.log(arr.concat([3, 4], 5, 6)); // 1,2,3,4,5,6
```

#### forEach

The `arr.forEach` method allows to run a function for every element of the array.

The syntax:

```
arr.forEach(function(item, index, array) {
  // ... do something with item
});
```

For instance, this shows each element of the array:

```
// for each element call alert
["Bilbo", "Gandalf", "Nazgul"].forEach(alert);
```

#### find

```
let users = [
  { id: 1, name: "John" },
  { id: 2, name: "Pete" },
  { id: 3, name: "Mary" }
];

let user = users.find(item => item.id == 1);

console.log(user.name); // John
```

#### filter

The `find` method looks for a single (first) element that makes the function return `true`.

If there may be many, we can use `arr.filter(fn)`.

The syntax is similar to `find`, but `filter` returns an array of all matching elements:

```
let results = arr.filter(function(item, index, array) {
  // if true item is pushed to results and the iteration continues
  // returns empty array if nothing found
});
```

For instance:

```
let users = [
  { id: 1, name: "John" },
  { id: 2, name: "Pete" },
  { id: 3, name: "Mary" }
];

// returns array of the first two users
let someUsers = users.filter(item => item.id < 3);

alert(someUsers.length); // 2
```

#### map

The `arr.map` method is one of the most useful and often used.

It calls the function for each element of the array and returns the array of results.

The syntax is:

```
let result = arr.map(function(item, index, array) {
  // returns the new value instead of item
});
```

For instance, here we transform each element into its length:

```
let lengths = ["Bilbo", "Gandalf", "Nazgul"].map(item => item.length);
console.log(lengths); // 5,7,6
```

#### sort

The call to `arr.sort()` sorts the array _in place_, changing its element order.

It also returns the sorted array, but the returned value is usually ignored, as `arr` itself is modified.

For instance:

```
let arr = [1, 2, 15];

// the method reorders the content of arr
arr.sort();

console.log(arr); // 1, 15, 2
```

```
function compareNumeric(a, b) {
  if (a > b) return 1;
  if (a == b) return 0;
  if (a < b) return -1;
}

let arr = [1, 2, 15];

arr.sort(compareNumeric);

console.log(arr); // 1, 2, 15
```

#### reverse

The method `arr.reverse` reverses the order of elements in `arr`.

For instance:

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.reverse();
console.log(arr); // 5,4,3,2,1
```

It also returns the array `arr` after the reversal.

#### split

The call to `split(s)` with an empty `s` would split the string into an array of letters:

```
let str = "test";

console.log(str.split('')); // t,e,s,t
```

#### join

The call `arr.join(glue)` does the reverse to `split`. It creates a string of `arr` items joined by `glue` between them.

For instance:

```
let arr = ['Bilbo', 'Gandalf', 'Nazgul'];

let str = arr.join(';'); // glue the array into a string using ;

alert(str); // Bilbo;Gandalf;Nazgul
```

#### reduce

When we need to iterate over an array we can use `forEach`, `for` or `for...of`.

When we need to iterate and return the data for each element - we can use `map`.

The methods `arr.reduce` and `arr.reduceRight` also belong to that breed, but are a little bit more intricate. They are used to calculate a single value based on the array.

The syntax is:

```
let value = arr.reduce(function(accumulator, item, index, array) {
  // ...
}, [initial]);
```

The function is applied to all array elements one after another and "carries on" its result to the next call.

Arguments:

- `accumulator` is the result of the previous function call, equals `initial` the first time (if `initial` is provided).
- `item` is the current array item.
- `index` is its position.
- `array` is the array.

#### reduce

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let result = arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);

alert(result); // 15
```

The function passed to `reduce` uses only 2 arguments, that's typically enough.

Let's see the details of what's going on.

- On the first run, `sum` is the initial value (the last argument of `reduce`), equals `0`, and `current` is the first array element, equals `1`. So the function result is `1`.
- On the second run, `sum = 1`, we add the second array element (`2`) to it and return.
- On the 3rd run, `sum = 3` and we add one more element to it, and so on...

#### Array.isArray

Arrays do not form a separate language type. They are based on objects.

So `typeof` does not help to distinguish a plain object from an array:

```
console.log(typeof {}); // object
console.log(typeof []); // object (same)
```

But arrays are used so often that there's a special method for that: `Array.isArray(value)`. It returns `true` if the `value` is an array, and `false` otherwise.

```
console.log(Array.isArray({})); // false
console.log(Array.isArray([])); // true
```

### Summary

- To add / remove elements:
  - `push(...items)` - adds items to the end.
  - `pop()` - extracts an item from the end.
  - `shift()` - extracts an item from the beginning.
  - `unshift(...items)` - adds items to the beginning.
  - `splice(pos, deleteCount, ...items)` - at index `pos` deletes `deleteCount` elements and inserts `items`.
  - `slice(start, end)` - creates a new array, copies elements from index `start` till `end` (not inclusive) into it.
  - `concat(...items)` - returns a new array: copies all members of the current one and adds `items` to it. If any of `items` is an array, then its elements are taken.
- To search among elements:
  - `indexOf / lastIndexOf(item, pos)` - look for `item` starting from position `pos`, return the index or `-1` if not found.
  - `includes(value)` - returns `true` if the array has `value`, otherwise `false`.
  - `find / filter(func)` - filter elements through the function, return first / all values that make it return `true`.
  - `findIndex` is like `find`, but returns the index instead of a value.
- To iterate over elements:
  - `forEach(func)` - calls `func` for every element, does not return anything.
- To transform the array:
  - `map(func)` - creates a new array from results of calling `func` for every element.
  - `sort(func)` - sorts the array in-place, then returns it.
  - `reverse()` - reverses the array in-place, then returns it.
  - `split / join` - convert a string to array and back.
  - `reduce / reduceRight(func, initial)` - calculate a single value over the array by calling `func` for each element and passing an intermediate result between the calls.
- Additionally:
  - `Array.isArray(value)` - checks if `value` is an array, if so returns `true`, otherwise `false`.
