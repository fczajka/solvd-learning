# TypeScript basics

### What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
- This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
- TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.

### Why should I use TypeScript?

- JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript
- In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.
- TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
- For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.
- TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.

### Static type-checking

Ideally, we could have a tool that helps us find bugs before our code runs. That's what a static type-checker like TypeScript does. Static types systems describe the shapes and behaviors of what our values will be when we run our programs. A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be going off the rails.

```
const message = 'hello!';
message();
// This expression is not callable.
// Type 'String' has no call signatures. ts(2349)
```

### How do I use TypeScript?

- A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpires TypeScript code into JavaScript.
- Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!

### TypeScript Compiler

- TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.
- TypeScript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that JavaScript runs!
- TypeScript has an official compiler which can be installed through npm:
  `npm install typescript --save-dev`

### Configuring the compiler

- can be configured using a `tsconfig.json` file

```json
{
  "include": ["src"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./build"
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Simple Types

There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript.

- `boolean` - true or false values
- `number` - whole numbers and floating point values
- `string` - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"

### Type Assignment

When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:

- **Explicit** - writing out the type:

  ```typescript
  let firstName: string = 'Dylan';
  ```

  - Explicit type assignments are easier to read and more intentional.

- **Implicit** - TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value:
  ```
  let firstName = 'Dylan';
  ```
  - Implicit type assignments are shorter, faster to type, and often used when developing and testing.
  - Implicit assignment forces TypeScript to infer the value.

### TypeScript Arrays

TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing arrays.

```
const names: string[] = [];
// names.push("Dylan"); // No Error
// names.push(3);    // Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```

The `readonly` keyword can prevent arrays from being changed:

```
const names: readonly string[] = ["Dylan"];
// names.push("Jack"); // Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.
// try removing the readonly modifier and see if it works?
```

TypeScript can infer the type of an array if it has values:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // Inferred to type number[]
// numbers.push(1); // no error
// comment line below out to see the successful assignment
// numbers.push("2"); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
let head: number | undefined = numbers[0]; // no error
```

### Typed Arrays (Tuples)

A tuple type is another sort of Array type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions.

Tuples are great because they allow each element in the array to be a known type of value.

To define a tuple, specify the type of each element in the array:

```
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'Coding God was here'];
```

As you can see we have a `number`, `boolean` and a `string`. But what happens if we try to set them in the wrong order:

```
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialized incorrectly which throws an error
// ourTuple = [false, 'Coding God was mistaken', 5];
```

### Array Union

A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types.

```
const unionType: (string | number)[] = [1, 'test', 213, 123, 'test2'];
```

### TypeScript Functions

TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing function parameters and return values. TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.

```
// the `: number` here specifies that this function returns a number
function getTime(): number {
  return new Date().getTime();
}
```

```
function multiply(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a * b;
}
```

If no parameter type is defined, TypeScript will default to using `any`, unless additional type information is available as shown in the Default Parameters and Type Alias sections below.

### TypeScript Functions

`void` return type is used where there is no data. For example, if a function does not return any value then you can specify `void` as return type.

```typescript
function printHello(): void {
  console.log('Hello!');
}
```

### TypeScript Object Types

TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing objects.

```typescript
const car: { type: string; model: string; year: number } = {
  type: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Corolla',
  year: 2009,
};
```

```typescript
const car = {
  type: 'Toyota',
};
car.type = 'Ford'; // no error
// car.type = 2;    // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

```typescript
const car: { type: string; mileage?: number } = {
  // no error
  type: 'Toyota',
};
car.mileage = 2000;
```

### Union Types

A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types.

```
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}
// OK
printId(101);
// OK
printId("202");
```

For example, TypeScript knows that only a `string` value will have a `typeof` value `"string"`:

```
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, id is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}
```

## Type Type Aliases

### Type Aliases

Type Aliases allow defining types with a custom name (an Alias).

Type Aliases can be used for primitives like `string` or more complex types such as objects and arrays:

```typescript
type CarYear = number;
type CarType = string;
type CarModel = string;
type Car = {
  year: CarYear;
  type: CarType;
  model: CarModel;
};

const carYear: CarYear = 2001;
const carType: CarType = 'Toyota';
const carModel: CarModel = 'Corolla';

const car: Car = {
  year: carYear,
  type: carType,
  model: carModel,
};
```

### Type Aliases

You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type. For example, a type alias can name a union type:

```typescript
type ID = number | string;
```

### Type Aliases

```typescript
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}

printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

### Type Aliases

Extending a type

```typescript
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

type Bear = Animal & {
  honey: boolean;
};
```

## TypeScript Special types

### Type: any

`any` is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.

**without any:**

```typescript
let u = true;
// u = "string"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
// Math.round(u); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

**with any:**

```typescript
let v: any = true;
v = 'string'; // no error as it can be "any" type
Math.round(v); // no error as it can be "any" type
```

`any` can be a useful way to get past errors since it disables type checking, but TypeScript will not be able provide type safety, and tools which rely on type data, such as auto completion, will not work. Remember, it should be avoided at `"any"` cost...

### Type: unknown

`unknown` is the type-safe counterpart of `any`. Anything is assignable to `unknown`, but `unknown` isn't assignable to anything but `itself` and `any` without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing.

```typescript
let vAny: any = 10; // We can assign anything to any
let vUnknown: unknown = 10; // We can assign anything to unknown just like any

let s1: string = vAny; // Any is assignable to string
let s2: string = vUnknown; // Invalid; we can't assign unknown to any other type (without an explicit assertion)

if (typeof vUnknown === 'string') {
  let s2: string = vUnknown; // WORKS! // NEED TO CHECK TYPEOF AND THEN ASSIGN THE VALUE
}
```

`unknown` is best used when you don't know the type of data being typed. To add a type later, you'll need to cast it. Casting is when we use the `"as"` keyword to say a property or variable is of the casted type.

### Type: never

`never` effectively throws an error whenever it is defined.

```typescript
let x: never = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.
```

`never` is rarely used, especially by itself; its primary use is in advanced generics.

### Type: undefined & null

`undefined` and `null` are types that refer to the JavaScript primitives `undefined` and `null` respectively.

```typescript
let y: undefined = undefined;
let z: null = null;
```

These types don't have much use unless `strictNullChecks` is enabled in the `tsconfig.json` file.
